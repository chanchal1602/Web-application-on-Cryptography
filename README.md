# Web-application-on-Cryptography
This is web-based project created using HTML, and Js. It is related to college Mini-Project where we have been asked to create a encryption and decryption tool. We focused more on the javascript alogrithm than the cool looking web page soon we will add designs too.
We added algorithms like,
1. vignere cipher
2. Hill cipher
3. RSA
4. RC4
5. SHA-256
6. MD5
7. DES
